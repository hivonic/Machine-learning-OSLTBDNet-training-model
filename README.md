This is a part of project that made application to classification tuberculosis base on xray image

the model is based on https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2025.107584 for preprocessing using method from https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265949
and dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset

thanks to those i can build an app with aim classification tuberculosis with low budget
